    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Jhon Lay, and I am aspiring with dreams of becoming a
      successful software engineer in the future. I am 21 years old and
      currently in my fourth year as an Information Technology student at the
      Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP), Taguig Branch. Over the
      course of my academic journey, I have developed a deep interest in
      technology, particularly in the field of web development. What draws me to
      web development is not only its practical applications and relevance in
      today’s digital age but also the creativity and problem-solving it
      entails. I find it incredibly exciting and rewarding to design and build
      interactive and functional websites that can make life easier for others.
      For me, web development is not just a skill to learn but an enjoyable and
      fulfilling activity that sparks my curiosity and fuels my passion for
      innovation. I am eager to deepen my knowledge, enhance my technical
      abilities, and ultimately turn my passion into a meaningful career.

    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
      When I’m not studying or working toward my goals, I enjoy spending time on
      my hobbies. I love watching movies and anime because they let me explore
      different stories and escape into exciting worlds. They help me relax and
      inspire my creativity. I also enjoy music, especially singing and playing
      the guitar. Singing makes me feel happy, and playing the guitar is a fun
      way to express myself. I like learning new songs and improving my skills
      little by little. These hobbies make my life more enjoyable and help me
      take a break from my busy days. They also give me a chance to connect with
      others who like the same things, which is always fun and rewarding.
    </p>
